There are two options to start your Bind container.

### Docker Run
Use this docker command to run the bind container.
```

-v /bindconfig:/etc/bind -v /bindlog:/var/log/named \
--restart=always pstauffer/bind
```

```
docker-compse up -d
```

## Bind Stuff

### Bind Configuration
To pass your configuration directory with all configs and files, you've to mount the volume into the docker container with the docker option:
```
-v <bindconfig>:/etc/bind
```

Please verify, that the owner of the files is set equal to the user-id of the named user in the container.
```
chown 1000:101 <bindconfig>/*
```

## Bind Logfiles
To log the bind logs on your docker host, just mount a directory into the docker container:
```
-v <logdir>:/var/log/named
```

Please verify, that the owner of the files is set equal to the user-id of the named user in the container.
```
chown 1000:101 <bindconfig>/*
```

## Bind Sample Configuration
A working bind configuration is provided in the [git repo](https://github.com/pstauffer/docker-bind/tree/master/bindconfig).
Just mount this example folder into the docker container and you're bind should work.

## Bind Test
You can test the dns responses with `dig` on the docker host.
```
dig webmail.example.com localhost
```
